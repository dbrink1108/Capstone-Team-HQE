# Peter Kiewit Institute Indoor Positioning System (PKIIPS)

A sensor system for determining and tracking the location of people within the Peter Kiewit Institute to aid in emergency evacuation.

## Overview

PKIIPS is divided into three components:

- **Seers** - sensor nodes used to gather data
- **Delphi** - central webserver to store information returned by sensors and performing routing algorithms
- **Oracle** consumer of the rest of the PKIIPS system to display the path and communicate it to users
